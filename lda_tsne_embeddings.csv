"I was going to say, Marcus over here was in the finals of the MVP of the American League, and here you are sitting here first Team. Does this validate the season you put together?",0,-3.8535805,-25.466162

" I managed to hit some of my shots close, and the ones that I didn't I managed to save par.",4,-22.996557,-15.904781

 I can't say that I turned it up because he doublefaulted three times.  I wish I could take credit for turning it up.,5,14.477314,6.601217

"I feel great. We've had good speed. I look at Vegas, if we didn't get the damage, get trapped down a lap there for a minute, we were really good there, capable of winning.",4,-26.34956,-14.574033
" It's just about fairest match I play. Today I was expected to do win, I came through, I'm expected to win tomorrow and I'll go out and do what I do and hopefully things work out.",0,1.1588845,-24.910854
 We just said that we are going to make a couple of tournaments before the Open and the Open.  We didn't talk afterwards.,7,10.523356,20.70193
"You obviously love your chances, you've won it twice before, what is it about that makes this event so special?",1,18.436127,-11.91754
It's not a bad four-year run. It almost feels like it got started against us a few years ago at our place. And they've had their foot on the gas pedal ever since.,1,19.006577,-14.1582155
"  I had so much champagne, I don't even remember what I said to my dad.  Probably I love him.  He's proud of me and I told him this is why we work, this is why we grind.  He congratulated me.",7,12.039872,28.003595
"  I hit pretty good tee shot and I have like 195 and it's like downwind, so I hit 6-iron and I have 20 feet and make the putt.",1,14.360154,-12.919088
"  I don't think Andre lacked anything.  I think Andre has all of the tools to be a great player, and he is a great player.",5,12.804016,4.997013
Absolutely. We're all about winning it all. That's what we're all about. That's what fan base is all about. I think we're going to field the Team that gives us the best opportunity to do that.,0,-0.32256934,-30.935585
" Last year I was here watching a little bit, yeah.  The year before, I am not sure, I might have been here too watching it.  I don't know.",7,11.655449,26.42395

"  No.  This Team does not get nervous.  We are a very poised, confident group.  We are prepared to go out and play each and every game, and this week is no different.",4,-23.724417,-15.470325
"I was trying to put away the hitter. For me something very big because that hitter is very big right now, he's on fire. And it's taking something special for me. And it was very good.",5,11.546651,5.6508913
"I mean, I think certainly early in the season that was a major factor. As the season has progressed, it's become less and less of a factor, but it's because we've had to adjust how we do business.",7,12.322664,26.455822
"We've been talking a lot. Talk a little bit about baseball, talk about his workouts, and other stuff. He's in a good place.",7,12.399872,29.30988

"I'm not thinking.  That's something that me and Matt have connected on before.  Incredible look by Matt, and I just had to do the easiest part and put it in the back of the net.",2,-4.6651273,-2.3613064
" Why, because they are all so good and they have done so many good things in golf.  They have won so many tournaments, their golf game is just close to perfection, so of course I am intimidated.",6,-7.8057704,19.60566
" Yeah, yeah, it's much better with my technique.  It's much better and now on I knew on hardcourt I couldn't play good.  I could play good, but now, I'm sure.",5,12.28458,13.658531
"I think it made a difference. We ran second, led some laps, ran second all day. We were just a little bit off on speed from the 18 I felt like.",2,-6.3980827,-3.5397725
"Yeah, it just depends on what type of hitter you are. Some people stick to your approach. Some people try to play along a little bit and kind of get a step ahead of him.",2,-3.8930898,3.6183572
  I felt like that a little bit.  I notice that Ally would always make it on top of me so I thought I was good motivation for her.,2,-4.2264853,-1.3838859
"  Oh, my God.  (Laughs) I'm done.  It was a struggle today, especially off the tee.  I think I was spending more time with the crowd than I was inside the ropes today.  So being very fan friendly today.",5,21.59514,6.830603
"This is something that, like I said, he came in yesterday and felt it a little bit and had these little spasms. Today he woke up and it was a lot worse.",2,-3.861419,3.234446
"Well, I wouldn't expect the worst strikeout Team to be in the World Series, you know what I'm saying? So I expect them to be good and they are really good.",6,-5.9794335,21.557049
 You've had an incredible season this year.  What do you put it down to?  You've been winning almost every other week.,7,11.7547245,23.362638
"First of all, I'll certainly give Salisbury the credit they deserve.  I thought they played a very good game today, very disciplined on offense, and their defense played tight all day.  I give them a lot of credit.",7,12.140239,31.726204
" Oh, absolutely.  What can I tell you? Three days, I have been all day in the place here trying to play some tennis.  Finally I could go out yesterday for a couple of hours to get something.",5,21.03915,6.261173
"  The snarl?  I kind of just did it.  I've never really made that face before, like ever in my really entire life.  Kind of just happened in the midst of things, in the moment.",0,-1.957449,-29.29172
" I don't know.  I haven't played on stadium.  But compared to the other courts, it is slower, yeah.  It is a little bit difficult for a serve and volley player to play well there.",7,11.933495,31.233292
"I echo that. When you have a place that you're proud of that you can go and say, This is such a beautiful field, let's all meet there, let's get together, the camaraderie, it's just amazing.",7,11.647834,26.463501
"  I'm definitely going to take some time off again.  I took a couple days off before this event, spend it with family.  I'm turning 23 on Wednesday and I don't know what I'm going to do yet.",1,20.014223,-15.684182
"I'll second that.  They are tremendous players but even better people off the field.  I mean, just their leadership and their charisma is very easy to follow.",6,-8.660674,23.956524
" Oh.  He is going to be tough.  I mean, he is very good player.  He is the top player.  So it is going to be tough.",5,13.405684,2.9048474
" I am not really looking that far ahead, playing Michael.  Right now I'm concerned about playing Enqvist and I will worry about it when the time comes.",2,-3.8822803,3.4388003
"Well, blocking against Jazz Sweet is pretty frustrating, I'm not going to lie but I think we did a pretty good job of staying patient. They were going to get there but we weren't going to get too frustrated.",0,-0.33028486,-30.948078
"All of them. I feel great, ready to go. This is exactly what I needed to get through here and get a little momentum built up. So feel good about all of them. ",3,-24.381899,8.235162
"  Well, I guess to me, it just means that I played on some very good Teams, that's all.  Fortunate to be on the Teams that have made it this far.",3,-26.264412,10.35254
"Obviously, there's measures in this contract that allow for the club to extend the payouts a few extra years in the contract that allows the immediacy of their payroll in the current year is where it has more flexibility.",1,18.057247,-11.243719
"Of course. That's always going to help. And, again, like I said before, every Team here is looking for starters because you can never have enough. That's just a fact.",0,-2.527216,-27.96395
"I truly believe -- we had opportunities today. We've been doing really well, driving in runs with men in scoring position; it just didn't happen today. So we'll come back tomorrow.",2,-8.03628,-4.926932
 To early to get in any kind of sense for me.  I don't think I have that much of a feel for the tournament yet.,5,9.616899,7.8021812
"No, we're not practicing that, but I have some knowledge about that. So we share the knowledge with the girls, and we take the decisions -- I talk to keeper and bowler and one senior player. That's it.",7,11.771335,25.235504
 I would say so.  Obviously depends on what we get tomorrow.  But I think these are the conditions you expect when you come over here.,6,-9.294792,22.531168
" Well, the 15 majors, but obviously that would be something very, very special.  I think so, yeah.  But hopefully before I get to 15, I'm up at 90.",4,-21.796051,-16.275965
"Yeah, it's a good question. I'm not the hiring authority, so I don't know, but I think it's important that we have really strong women in positions of leadership in our sport.",5,11.792141,8.532383
 I dived because I had to get the point and there was a little bit of luck and I got it.,3,-23.4691,8.791923
"I'm actually looking at him right now, he just walked in my office. We haven't talked yet. I'm going to find out his status. He's going to talk to you in a few minutes.",0,1.2331274,-24.874426
" Yeah, I would definitely say so.  The approaches are also difficult to play in this kind of windy conditions, but still, I think it gives her more problems to pass me than for me coming in.  That is for sure.",7,7.4245863,22.614838
  You don't get a chance to know each other too well.  The thing I know about him is he is a great leader for his football Team and he is a great player.,5,12.988329,11.015682
"There was a lot of things that could happen with lap cars, him guessing wrong, me being able to run the bottom or run the top or get a good run or something along those lines. It never materialized. ",4,-25.130243,-14.611231
"Marisnick? Jake is an impact defender, he's got some base running skills that we can utilize hitting in front of the pitcher. He's got a little bit of history with Corbin, having done pretty well with him.",7,12.361211,30.220165
"  It was fun.  It's nice having my brother on the bag, but it's cool.  This is the first time dad has caddied for me since I've been on tour.",0,-4.11212,-26.214445
" Obviously, it didn't.  Usually I play pretty well when I have an injury, but normally I don't make it a habit.",0,-3.6524076,-27.184961
I think we obviously have to respond from last night.  It's always about what's in front of you.  Whatever is behind is in the past.  You have no control over it.,1,18.056055,-11.241504
"  Yeah, you know, we realized what they were doing defensive-wise, so we had a much better offensive output in this game, move the ball, move the ball, move the ball, and skew their defense.",7,11.771607,25.232203
"Yeah, to be honest, we haven't talked all about it. I know he had a great run. I think we all respect his career beyond just that. Yeah, just trying to get better.",7,11.850833,30.237932
"No, for me, he just got -- he starts the game, he gets a little quick. But then he settled down for a little bit and then Chirinos hit a good change-up.",2,-4.9510565,-2.0934136
  Probably on 16.  That was the longest putt that I holed today.  It was kind of across the green down there by the water.,7,9.626561,22.083805
" No.  Each one wants to do the best she can.  But we don't think ""I want to be better than my sister.""  Each one wants to do the best she can, but for herself.",0,-4.112875,-26.21574
" Absolutely.  I'd like to see Michelle, although I didn't want her to win on Sunday because I wanted to win, but as it turned out neither of us won; obviously Karrie won.",0,-0.7048647,-21.746016
Michigan State was a physical Team.  They dominated us in all three aspects of the game.  I thought they were a really well coached Team and physical throughout all four quarts.,4,-25.131115,-14.609138
"Well, we feel like we're -- two years ago now this next year we feel like coming into this next season that's going to be the goal. It should be when you have won back-to-back 97-game seasons.",1,14.490516,-12.87809
"I agree with everything they said. I couldn't have asked for a better senior year, and I'm just so thankful for everyone (tearing) Texas A&M volleyball has a really bright future and I'm excited to watch.",2,-8.025153,-5.333308
"Yeah, absolutely, I got a couple to fix up about my mechanic, and I want to work this offseason about that.",1,17.814577,-11.438734
" Not many people would, but if someone starts to mention, hey, this and that the other, I say listen I could careless.",0,-2.907551,-24.414587
"Yeah, that line's been great for us whenever they're together.  Robby came in, brought some speed, some legs.  Looked pretty good.",7,12.310147,26.490797
 Not particularly.  I think surface probably suits him a little more than it suits me.  Probably more comfortable on this than he is on grass.,3,-26.264267,10.350765
"Obviously very proud to have followed Fernando Valenzuela, obviously something historic, and something that I'm obviously very happy about, very happy to have followed him and to have done what I've done today.",4,-23.963219,-15.891944
I don't know about it is remarkable.  I think it is a testament of what people can endure or persevere.,5,13.290885,6.7609234
"Well, you're right, he was good in the No. 1 spot.  He was playing well, he likes to play fast, he was comfortable playing in the No. 1 spot.  Get out there and go, you know.",5,19.41519,6.6710286
"Enjoy it. Honestly, it's stuff you gotta go through. I got a lot of advice from friends of mine. Kevin Cash, he's one of them. Something you gotta go through.",7,12.315346,26.49467
"  Well, I don't know if that's true or what it is.  I think preparation and opportunity, those two things combine, good things happen.",0,-1.5875939,-29.0003
"  Definitely feel a certain level of disconnection.  When you're here, you very much feel like you're in a bubble and kind of secluded and separated from the outside world.",0,-0.74673957,-29.956888
 Is this the best win that you have ever had against a big player or have you beaten another top player?,2,-2.9790492,0.7372644
"  I tell you tomorrow.  It is nothing knew to me.  I mean, I have been playing singles, doubles, mixed doubles at the tournaments, so it is no different than any other tournament.",5,5.4558463,4.128457
" I will ask Tiger the same question after being the lead now at 6-under.  Some thoughts on your round today, and if you could go through your round card, if you don't mind.",2,-4.948132,-2.1037498
"  You know, just being aggressive.  Taking the same shots that I took last game, and just having confidence in that.  My Teammates have confidence in me to score the ball.",6,-9.164297,23.986029
" There was a serve.  It is difficult from the other side to judge a serve, but I felt it was out.",4,-21.125841,-15.550208
"And one more thing to add, the humidors don't really address the issue of drag. The humidors will affect the coefficient of restitution, but sort of the topic of drag isn't likely to be impacted by that.",6,-9.295266,22.532005
"  I think what everybody sees in them, they are very athletic.  They don't give up a lot of big plays and they make good plays.",0,-3.6523106,-27.185076
 I am just going to let the Europeans do it because we are on deadline and if we want to go back to English we can.,1,16.090956,-11.079078
"No, I don't think so.  He's a good defender, and I mean, I only one scored goal, so he did his job, I guess, and he played his position well.",5,12.445462,6.2318587
"It was pretty clear??Ãª<U+0080><U+0091>cut. The 21 hung a left, drove those guys down below the line. We called that twice on the 22 car during the race, so nothing different there.",7,7.7204547,22.615108
"Well, it's obviously a different experience.  Something that I'll definitely remember.  Something  that I'll look back on with fond memories.",6,-8.67958,23.109661

"Again, an incredible look by Matt Moore.  He did the grit, and I just saw a shooting lane and I took it.  But Matt Moore did an incredible job, eyes up, and to see the player he's become is incredible.",7,12.361092,30.224894
"Obviously we played a lot of world-class Teams in this tournament. But this performance would probably be one to remember by the players themselves, giving them motivation, and also for the fans back home as well.",4,-25.941435,-13.943074
"They positioned themselves pretty well. But we hit some balls hard. Trea hit a couple balls hard today, actually three balls hard. We've just got to keep battling.",5,21.984121,6.180087
"  It feels pretty good.  It is always good to win a Grand Slam title even in mixed.  I think very special and you only have so many chances to win them, they are good to take.",0,0.048686616,-31.559917
My mom is someone that I talk to a lot and obviously she helped me out this morning. We had coffee. Just gave me some words of encouragement.,7,9.574721,21.172728

"Good afternoon, everyone. I have a couple of topics that I would like to cover and then obviously I will take questions, some of which I may answer.",1,18.431852,-11.913133
I am just very happy to be there.  It is just -- it is no time to be surprised or not to be surprised.,5,13.291673,6.760175
" He's going to come out swinging, he's got a really nice backhand and he's been playing well all week, and I hope I can put the pressure on him and serve like I did today and we'll see what happens.",4,-27.024038,-13.692694
I will still working on the same thing because like the first two hole I keep thinking about the outcome and I don't have good commitment at all.,0,-4.108848,-26.2094

"  It was a good settler.  I felt like I started fine, a little bit more steady than yesterday, so to roll that birdie in was good to gain some momentum for the rest of the day.",2,-7.499385,-4.3246236
"  I'm doing the same thing.  I'm gassing him up.  I feel like I'm putting that battery in his back.  There's a lot of times I tell him, ""Don't pass.""",5,10.597889,4.7450266
"I think that's an Individual thing. Players have to pick themselves up. Management or anyone can go out and give advice, but at the end of the day, it's up to the player to go out there and execute.",5,12.330754,13.461588
"Let me just add to that, that when Lloyd says we have no idea, you could interpret that to mean that nobody in this world has any idea because, if Lloyd doesn't know, then nobody knows. (Laughter.)",1,15.780102,-11.049121
"Obviously you can always shut the short.  So maybe give them something different.  Coach Conry was like  Nope, we're sticking to who we are and what we're all about.",2,-2.9254355,-0.039601985

" When you win a few matches, I beat good players, then you get more confidence and then you know that you can beat good players.  So that has happened a lot.",5,20.323416,6.3329616
"It's not what I want to be here talking about. And hopefully when AJ gets in here, he'll get back to talking about Game 3 and this series.",4,-23.190575,-16.386139
"To be honest with you, that probably helped distract me through the majority of the week. Just being able to talk about something else, not being so caught up in a points situation.",6,-9.43519,23.078428
"Yeah, it's been a long year, up and down.  All worth it in the end.  Obviously a little bonus scoring that goal last night, too.",1,18.481928,-12.768342

"ORLANDO HERNANDEZ (Through Leo Astacio)   I have given thought to everyone on their Team.  Luis Gonzalez, he's a member of that Team and I have thought about all of them.",4,-21.802605,-16.28081
"  Yeah, well, I knew that today playing in the morning, especially early, was going to be much more difficult than yesterday, as was shown by the scores yesterday morning.",5,21.038563,6.2617416
